What’s in the Telco Customer Churn data set?

A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their
landline service line for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. This
analysis shows who is leaving and why.

The data set includes information about:

• Churn: Customers who left within the last month
• Services that each customer signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online
security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
• Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment
method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
• Demographic information: gender, age range, and if they have partners and
dependents

Guiding questions:
• What are the key drivers of churn?
• How would you identify customers who are most likely to churn next?
